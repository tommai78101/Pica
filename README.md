# citro3d-physics (YET TO BE NAMED...)

This project is a physics library extension for citro3D, providing a lightweight alternative for physics-based simulation. Currently undergoing construction. Readme.md will be updated when necessary. It is theoretically lighter than the well-known Bullet open-source physics engine, but ported for the Nintendo 3DS family system.

citro3d is a library that provides an easy to use stateful interface to the PICA200 GPU of the Nintendo 3DS. It tries to expose hardware functionality in the way that is most natural and convenient to the GPU and the user, therefore deviating from openGL.

Yes, citro3d is spelled with a lowercase C.

It is written in C programming language.

# Setup

citro3d can be built and installed using the following command:

    make install
